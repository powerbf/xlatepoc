# Context mappings (German)
#
# This is used to map the contexts used in code to (a lesser number of) contexts used in the translations
# The purpose of this is to ease the burden on the translators and avoid repitition.
# This is important for languages like German where words are inflected with grammatical case.
# For languages where this is not needed (e.g. French), set all msgstr to empty string.
